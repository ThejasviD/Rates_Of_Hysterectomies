In this project I am evaluating how an intervention impacted rates of different types of hysterectomies within a hospital. There are different types of hysterectomies, coded as TVH, TAH, TLH, etc. Data was collected across 5 blocks. Each block is a time period when an intervention aimed at medical providers was conducted. For example, a lecture was given to physicians to encourage more TVH's. The objective was to test if the interventions made a difference in the rate of TVH's. In this R file, I created a summary table, and a contingency table. Then, I conducted a Chi-Squared test, a Fisher's Exact Test, then pairwise tests to evaluate how the proportions of TVH's differ across blocks.
